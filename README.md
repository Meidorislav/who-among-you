## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with **TypeScript**
- **Vite** for fast builds and HMR
- **React Router** for navigation
- **i18next** for localization
- **CSS Modules** for scoped styling

### Backend
- **Go 1.26**
- **Chi** for lightweight HTTP routing
- **Gorilla WebSocket** for real-time communication
- **UUID** for secure session and player identification
- **PostgreSQL** for storing questions (optional; mock data used if not configured)

### Infrastructure
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for containerization
- **Caddy** as a reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Go 1.26+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized deployment)
- [PostgreSQL 17](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (optional; mock questions used if not configured)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/who-among-you.git
   cd who-among-you
   ```

2. **(Optional) Set up PostgreSQL:**
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/whoyou"
   ```
   If `DATABASE_URL` is not set, the backend will use mock questions.

3. **Run the Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go run cmd/who-among-you/main.go
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Run the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Docker Deployment

To spin up the entire stack (Frontend + Backend + Caddy):

1. **Configure Environment:**
   Create a `.env` file from the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Set your `DOMAIN` in the `.env` file.

2. **Start with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
